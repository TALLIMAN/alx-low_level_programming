This project involves the use of pointers and arrays and strings to solve and provide solutions for the problems below.

#0-reset_to_98.c
In this project, a function was created to point at the int variable and change the value of the variable by deferencing using the pointer.

#1-swap.c
in this project, the use of pointers to point to another pointer.

#2-strlen.c
in this project, a function that prints the exact amount of bytes the values used based on the data type of variable

#3-puts.c
in this project, a function that prints the string followed by a new line

#4-print_rev.c
in this project, a function that prints the string in reverse. to be able to do this, the lenght of the string had to be found so that a pointer can be assignedto the to enable printing backwards.
