This project is for variables and some loops.

#task 1: this task involves the completion of the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable n is positive or negative. hence to print the this we have to create an if statement because that is the way to print out the multiple outputs as stated in the requirements of the question.

#task 3: this task involves printing out the alphabets using putchar function which prints out from standard input to the screen.
